    {% if select == "illuminati" %}
      <p>
        Illuminati is the supreme deity of the Vallheru pantheon. Different races envision this divine being in their own ways.
        Among Humans and Dwarves, Illuminati takes the form of a man of their respective race, while Elves perceive the deity as an elven woman. 
        Unlike other gods, Illuminati does not focus on a single aspect of existence but instead bestows blessings upon followers in many different ways. 
        The sacred symbol of this deity is a white flame set against a golden diamond.
      </p>
    {% elif select == "karserth" %}
      <p>
        Followers of Karserth, much like their god, are more often found on the battlefield than in a temple. 
        Karserth is the Lord of War, cherishing his devotees for their bravery and prowess in combat while scorning cowards. 
        To different races, he appears in distinct forms—among Humans and Dwarves, he is seen as a mighty warrior clad in a grand, 
        intricately adorned suit of armor, while Elves perceive him as a slender, enigmatic figure draped in a ranger’s cloak, 
        wielding a war bow. He grants his followers strength and mastery in battle, forging them into relentless warriors. 
        His sacred symbol is a crossed sword and arrow, representing both close and ranged combat.
      </p>
    {% elif select == "anariel" %}
      <p>
        The most mysterious goddess of the Vallheru pantheon. She is the guardian of magic and all beings who practice it. 
        She demands that her followers continually develop their magical abilities. Mortals envision her as a female figure clad in 
        enchanted robes, with a deep hood covering her face. An aura of immense magical power radiates from her, shimmering with arcane energy.
        This goddess grants her followers strength and mastery in the arcane arts, empowering them with mystical abilities. Her sacred symbol, 
        a glowing blue vortex, swirls above her, pulsing with raw magical energy.
      </p>
    {% elif select == "heluvald" %}
      <p>
        He is the most peaceful of all the gods of Vallheru, uninterested in power or bloodshed. Heluvald is the patron of craftsmen and merchants.
        Among all races, he is depicted either as a short, bearded man wearing a blacksmith’s apron or as a handsome merchant dressed in richly 
        adorned clothing, with a mysterious smile on his face. He supports his followers by granting them knowledge and skills in various crafts. 
        His sacred symbol is a stack of golden coins.
      </p>    
    {% elif select == "tartus" %}
      <p>
        Tartus is one of the Fallen Gods, cast down by the Great Four. Once a wielder of immense power, he was later exiled and cursed. 
        Millennia passed before he returned once more to the world of mortals.
        <br /><br />
        Tartus appears as a tall and slender elven warrior with long dark hair. In his right hand, he wields a long sword, 
        while in his left, he holds a magical sphere of fire. His obsidian plate armor and greaves contrast starkly with his pale, 
        flesh-toned skin. From his back sprout massive, flaming wings resembling those of a phoenix, allowing him to hover majestically in the air.
        <br /><br />
        A master of fire magic and the infernal planes, Tartus seized and conquered many fallen astral realms during his exile, 
        where he bent vast legions of demons and fiends to his will. Because of this, he is also highly skilled in summoning demonic entities. 
        Once venerated by several elven and lizardfolk tribes, he is now condemned by most races. Humans and halflings fear his demonic aura, 
        considering him a god of evil and the underworld. Lizardfolk and dwarves reject his magic, referring to him as the God of Darkness. 
        Only the elves still retain fragmented memories of the time when Tartus was honored by the Great Four.
        <br /><br />
        Despite his dark reputation, Tartus has become the patron of battle mages and fire elves, who revere his power and draw 
        divine strength from him. Recently, the number of his followers in the world of Vallheru has been growing, especially 
        among sorcerers and demon summoners. Additionally, Tartus is known to listen to and bless warriors skilled in melee combat, 
        answering their battle prayers and granting them strength.
      </p>    
    {% elif select == "oregarl" %}
      <p>
        Oregarl is depicted as a strong and sturdy dwarf with broad shoulders and a prominent chest. His long, silver beard flows over his
        gleaming plate armor, which he always wears. In his hands, he wields a massive warhammer and a shield. Upon the shield, his sacred 
        symbol is emblazoned: a clenched fist crossed with a hammer.
        <br /><br />
        Over a thousand years ago, in the lands of Vallheru near the Kazad-nar mountains, a great war raged between the forces of darkness 
        and the legions of dwarves. As evil grew stronger, dwarven priests prayed fervently, seeking their god’s blessing. 
        Deep beneath the earth, within a sacred temple, the avatar of Oregarl manifested, summoned by the priests. 
        He blessed the city and the valiant dwarven warriors who defended it.
        <br /><br />
        Despite this divine intervention, the dwarven stronghold could not withstand the relentless assault. The city fell, leaving only the 
        temple untouched, where Oregarl’s avatar remained. The entrances were sealed with protective glyphs and runes, ensuring that no evil 
        could ever breach its sanctum. Though the priests safeguarded the temple, they were unable to pass on their sacred knowledge, and over 
        time, the religion was forgotten.
        <br /><br />
        Oregarl watches over dwarves who fight in close combat, as well as those who advance the craft of stonework, metallurgy, and blacksmithing. 
        He teaches loyalty, perseverance, and the mastery of material craftsmanship. He bestows his blessings upon those who fight in his name 
        against the forces of evil.
      </p>    
    {% elif select == "daeraell" %}
      <p>
        Daeraell is the Goddess of the Forsaken, the Bringer of Hope.<br>
        Born from sorrow and woven from the weeping of mortals, Daeraell emerged as a beacon for those abandoned by fate. 
        The elves have long preserved the tale of her creation, a legend whispered among the ancient groves and forgotten ruins.
        <br /><br />
        It is said that one evening, as the celestial deity Illuminati rested upon his favored glade, he reached out with his divine grasp 
        to listen to the thoughts of the world. Within his hands, magic swirled, gathering the voices of mortals into an ethereal sphere. 
        Yet to his great dismay, what he heard was not songs of joy nor whispers of contentment, but an ocean of sorrow—endless cries of grief, 
        pain, and despair. The burden was too great even for a god, and so, unable to contain it, he cast it forth.
        <br /><br />
        The sorrow fell to the heart of the forest, pooling into a lake as dark as the abyss, its waters inky and unfathomable. 
        A place of mourning, untouched by light. Yet Illuminati, unable to bear the thought of leaving the forsaken without hope,
        plucked a single strand of his own hair and cast it upon the abyssal waters. From the sacred union of sorrow and divinity,
        Daeraell was born—a goddess to carry light to the broken and forgotten.
        <br /><br />
        She walks the land as a tall, ethereal woman with dark brown skin, glowing white eyes, and hair so long and pale it shimmers with an otherworldly 
        greenish aura. Wherever she treads, white lilies bloom, and swallows forever dance in her wake. The dwarves call her Nerin Snowmirth, 
        though their forges no longer ring with her name.
        <br /><br />
        Though time and war sought to erase her worship, the memory of Daeraell has never fully faded. In Minas Tirth, her name was whispered once more, 
        her faith rekindled, and with it, her presence returned to the lands of Vallheru. One legend tells of how, during a siege upon a great city, 
        a group of orphaned children huddled together in fear, offering desperate prayers to the lost goddess. As the enemy marched upon them, Daeraell came, 
        covering the children with her flowing hair, shrouding them from sight. When the invaders passed, the children remained—untouched, unseen, 
        saved by the Goddess of the Forsaken.
        <br /><br />
        Her followers, though few, tend hidden shrines where white lily petals are ever-present, a silent testament to her presence. 
        They believe that as long as suffering lingers in the world, so too shall Daeraell remain. Some claim she has blessed the needy with fortune, 
        guided craftsmen’s hands so that their work may flourish, and even filled the bellies of the starving, whispering nourishment into existence.
        <br /><br />
        She does not demand worship, nor does she seek devotion. She is simply there, watching over the lost, the broken, and the weary—offering, 
        in the darkest of nights, a flicker of hope.
      </p>    
    {% elif select == "teathe-di" %}
      <p>
        Teathe-di, the patroness of female thieves, is renowned for both her beauty and her storied past. Her depictions remain elusive and enigmatic. 
        She bears the appearance of an elf, yet stands as short as a halfling. Some portray her with golden hair, gleaming like the setting sun, 
        while others paint her locks as dark as the cloak of night. Only one detail remains constant across all depictions—her face is always adorned 
        with a mischievous smirk, a reflection of her cunning nature.
        <br /><br />
        The goddess is clad in black warrior’s garments, her waist wrapped in a wide silken sash. A masterfully crafted bow is slung across her back, 
        and the feathered fletchings of arrows peek from over her shoulder, ever ready for the perfect shot.
        <br /><br />
        Ancient legends tell of a time when she was a swift and deadly archer, admired by all the gods. The entire pantheon envied her grace, her charm, 
        and her unparalleled agility. Yet, one fateful day, she revealed her true nature—a rebel, a trickster, a thief of divine caliber.
        <br /><br />
        Listening to the whispered prayers of the cunning and the desperate, she stole celestial artifacts from the very halls of the gods, pilfering 
        essential astral components that fueled the power of the divine. Enraged, the gods cursed her name and cast her from their ranks, branding her 
        the goddess of wretched rogues.
        <br /><br />
        Since that day, Teathe-di has embraced her exile, becoming the unseen hand behind the black dealings of thief-archers. She still hears their prayers, 
        delighting in their cunning pursuits and reveling in their audacious exploits. From the shadows, she watches, guiding those who dare to follow her path, 
        continuing her celestial craft in the realm of mortals with a smirk that never fades.
      </p>
    {% elif select == "thindil" %}
      <p>
        Thindil was the First King, God of Valor and Brotherhood. Once a mortal ruler, Thindil was the first king of Vallheru, uniting scattered tribes under his 
        banner. When the old world fell, he ascended as a god, his spirit rising beyond the ruins of his lost kingdom. Now, he watches over the brave, 
        granting his blessings to warriors who fight with honor, chieftains who protect their kin, and tribes who stand united. He is depicted as a towering warrior, 
        clad in ancient royal armor, wielding a crowned war axe, his sacred symbol. His spectral form is said to walk beside warriors in battle, guiding their blades 
        and whispering the oaths of old. His followers carve his mark into their weapons, believing it grants them strength and protection. Though kings may rise 
        and fall, Thindil remains eternal, ever watching over those who live and die with honor.
